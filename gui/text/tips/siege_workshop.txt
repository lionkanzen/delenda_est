SIEGE WORKSHOP
Build these to construct siege weapons and research their improvements.
These types of siege weapons can be constructed here: Battering Ram, Bolt Shooter, Catapult, Fire Raiser, and Siege Tower.
Not every faction will have access to every type of siege weapon. They are faction-specific.
Unlock the ability for your soldiers to build Field Catapults by building a Workshop.
