	"description": "The Celts were the first to invent soap as we know it. Despite their reputation among the more 'civilized' peoples in the South as savage barbarians, the Celts stressed hygiene, going so far as shaving their bodies to prevent fleas and other pests from taking root. Soap at this time was very acidic, only allowing people to bathe with it at most once per week.",
