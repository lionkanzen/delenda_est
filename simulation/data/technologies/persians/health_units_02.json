	"description": "A qanāt or kārēz is a gently sloping underground channel with a series of vertical access shafts, used to transport water from an aquifer under a hill. They create a reliable supply of water for human settlements and irrigation in hot, arid, and semi-arid climates. The technique is known to have been developed by the Persian people sometime in the early 1st millennium BC, and spread from there slowly westward and eastward.",
