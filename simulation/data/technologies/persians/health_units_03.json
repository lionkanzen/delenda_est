	"description": "A yakhchāl is an ancient type of evaporative cooler. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but has a subterranean storage space; it was often used to store ice, but sometimes was used to store food as well. The subterranean space coupled with the thick heat-resistant construction material insulated the storage space year round. These structures were mainly built and used in Persia. Many that were built hundreds of years ago remain standing.",
