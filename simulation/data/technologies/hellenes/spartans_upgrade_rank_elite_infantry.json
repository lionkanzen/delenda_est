	"description": "The term mothakes was used for a sociopolitical class in ancient Sparta, particularly during the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC). The mothakes were primarily either offspring of Spartiate fathers and helot mothers or children of impoverished Spartiates. Mothakes were not able to contribute to the syssitia, the core civic daily institution for citizens, and thus were not allowed to maintain an equal status. They were, however, permitted to fight as troops along with Perioikoi.",
