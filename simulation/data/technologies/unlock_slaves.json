	"description": "Slave markets were ubiquitous throughout the ancient world. It is notable that the Persians stood out as one of the few cultures who did not practice slavery in a form that we recognize. The lifestyle of a slave depended a lot upon the position of their master. State-owned slaves usually had lower lifespans and a much lower standard of living than those owned by private citizens.",
