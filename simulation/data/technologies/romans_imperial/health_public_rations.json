	"description": "The grain supply to the city of Rome can not be met entirely from the surrounding countryside, which is taken up by the villas and parks of the aristocracy and which produces mainly fruit, vegetables and other perishable goods. The city therefore is increasingly reliant on grain supplies from other parts of Italy, notably Campania, and from elsewhere in the empire, particularly the provinces of Sicily, North Africa and Egypt. These regions are capable of shipping adequate grain for the population of the capital amounting to 60 million modii (540 million litres / 540,000 cubic metres or 135 million gallons / 16.8 million bushels) annually, according to the Praefectus Annonae. These provinces and the shipping lanes that connect them with Ostia and other important ports thus are of great strategic importance. Whoever controls the grain supply has an important measure of control over the city of Rome. (Wikipedia)",
