    <History>Writing in the 2nd century BC, Polybius (The Histories; 5.83) described the inferiority of the Ptolemaic war elephants in battle due to the supposedly larger size of the Indian elephants used by the Seleucid kings. This lead many scholars to believe the Ptolemies were using the small North African Forest Elephant found in ancient Libya and Mauritania. However, a surviving Ptolemaic inscription enumerates three types of war elephant, the "Troglodytic" (probably Libyan or North African), the "Ethiopian", and the "Indian" (Asian). The Ptolemaic king prides himself with being the first to tame the Ethiopian elephants, a stock which we now know to be genetically identical to African Savanna Elephants. The inferiority of the Ptolemaic war elephants can now be surmised to be due to the African Savanna Elephant's more temperamental and unpredictable nature when compared to the easier-to-train Indian elephant, and not because the Ptolemies used smaller elephants.</History>
