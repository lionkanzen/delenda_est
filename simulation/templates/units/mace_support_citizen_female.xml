    <History>Macedonian women were mothers, first and foremost. They had few rights and a low station. Lower class women labored the land and, only when necessary, tended the family shop. Middle and upper class women were relegated almost exclusively to home life. Be that as it may, they were masters of the home and servants, their husbands often deferred to their wives in domestic matters. Some Macedonian women did wield uncommon influence in politics, the most famous being Olympias, mother of Alexander.</History>
